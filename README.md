# Pig-Dice  
#### <em>by Rehan Ali</em>

## Description of project:
This is a game where two players play dice. On their turn to play, they may choose to roll the die or hold.

## Set up requirements:
The players need to have access to internet. They should then go to https://github.com/redin22/Pig-Dice to play the game.
The players have to be two.

## Specifications/ rules:

Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":
1. If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
2. If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
3. If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
4. The first player to score 100 or more points wins.

## Known bugs:
